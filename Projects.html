                            I have spent 2020 to present working on the Caltrain project with Stadler Rail that is set to begin service in a couple years. This is a train line that will run from San Francisco to Gilroy California. This all electric, double-decker passenger train will be helping people get from place to place in the Bay Area. <br>
                            <br>
                            Personally, I have worked as the type test engineer for this project. This role has allowed me to work in the electrical, mechanical, and software fields of engineering and ensure that the project is meeting the proper timelines as well as specifications. A broad list of technical skills are applied daily as well as many people skills to keep it all running smoothly.

                            I have been up to some web development as well! From small bussinesses to my own personal projects, I've tried to branch out as much as possible. This portfolio was one of my first projects and continues to evolve as I do.<br>

                            Who says you have to get paid to learn something new? <br>
                            <br>
                            I have been working on an indoor, totally automated greenhouse for several months now. As my covid project, it has helped my learn to code in a new langauge (Node.red) as well as wire new and exciting sensors. My goal is to have fresh veggies and herbs for the kitchen, year round and totally without any care. <br>
                            <br>
                            The idea is to allow the plants to have everything that they will need with little to no intervention. I have automated lights, humidity, and watering all contained in a glass cabinet driven by a Raspberry Pi. I plan to add more as I complete sections of the build.
