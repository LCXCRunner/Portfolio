                            I absolutly adore learning more about science and technologies, my interests are very broad in these fields and continue to grow as I learn more. I often find myself facinated with whatever field i begin to take part in. <br>
                            <br>
                            I love anything and everything that can fly, I look forward to learning more about things of this variety in the future.

                            <br>
                            I am also an avid skier, hiker, aviator, and gamer. I am working towards my PPL (Private Pilot's License) on the weekends and I take every minute I can to enjoy the great outdoors wherever I find myself. 
                            When I am not oudoors or in the air I am most likely to be found online playing some video games to keep in contact with my friends from all over.

                            While Covid may have slowed me down, I very much enjoy a little bit of globe trotting. <br>
                            <br>
                            I think that my favorite thing about the world is the food and the interesting places that you can see along the way. I take as many photos of my travels as I can and mostly enjoy landscapes and flowers. <br>
                            <br>
                            The background you're enjoying now is actually one of my best photos!
